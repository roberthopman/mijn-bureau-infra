# Intro

MijnBureau is a flexible and secure digital workplace suite. Its main goal is to provide an **autonomous** solution for digital workplaces, ensuring you can run everything on your own hardware and maintain full control over your critical data.

MijnBureau is developed in collaboration with Dutch municipalities, provinces, and ministries, inspired by similar initiatives such as Germany’s Opendesk and France’s LaSuite.

While MijnBureau is a public-driven initiative, our license choice is an invitation for private sector actors to use, sell and contribute to the project.

## Features

MijnBureau already offers a rich set of features, with a strong focus on collaboration:

- Collaborative Documents
