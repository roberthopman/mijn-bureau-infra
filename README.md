`MijnBureau` is a collaboration suite build for civil servants. It provides a flexible and secure digital workplace with a strong focus on autonomy. Features included are collaborative document editing, file sharing, chat, video conferencing, and many more. See [documentation](https://minbzk.github.io/mijn-bureau-infra/docs/category/features) for all features.

## Overview

MijnBureau is a flexible and secure digital workplace suite. Its main goal is to provide an **autonomous** solution for digital workplaces, ensuring you can run everything on your own hardware and maintain full control over your critical data.

MijnBureau is developed in collaboration with Dutch municipalities, provinces, and ministries, inspired by similar initiatives such as Germany’s Opendesk and France’s LaSuite.

While MijnBureau is a public-driven initiative, our license choice is an invitation for private sector actors to use, sell and contribute to the project.
